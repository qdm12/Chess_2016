Chess 2016, NYU

Ideas:
- Use an online website for chess to compute AI movements by exchanging chess states somehow
- Add translations
- Change graphics (Alexandra) and add animations
- Check game logic, found bug when game is over nothing is said
- Use the Chess repo from previous year and integrate it in this one
